# React Router DOM

React Router DOM의 개념들을 익히고 사용해보자.

## 개념

### `Router`

react router DOM의 wrapper component로
가장 최상단 컴포넌트 밖에 씌워준다.
> Example
``` react
ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
  <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```



### `Route`

url path에 따라 어떤 Component가 실행될지 정해주는 녀석.
> Example
``` react
<Route exact path="/"><Home></Home></Route>
```
 exact는 path와 정확히 일치하는 url에 대한 부분일 때만 동작하게 하는 녀석.


### `Link`

### `Switch`

### `NavLink`

### `useParams`



### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
